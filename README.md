#General:
	-Posts are called 'toots' rather than 'tweets'
	-Posting someone else's toot is 'boosting' rather than 'retweeting'
	-Content Warnings are a thing here.  
		-Content Warnings are like subject lines for your toots
			-People have to click the CW to view the toot
		-This is a bit of an interesting subject.  Most people are very much in favor of CWs, but a good portion of the community feels that it's a hindrance. 
			-Whatever side of the fence you're on, be sure to read your instance's rules as they may have guidelines to follow.
	-DMs are different
		-They're technically not direct to person messages like on Twitter
			-When you DM someone it just sets the visibility of your message to only the people you mentioned in the toot
	-Sometimes you like to participate in a good ole dumpster fire.  (Un)Fortunately, you're not going to find that here.  Most moderators and admins are a bit stricter on what content they allow on their instance.  So while it's fun to call a fascist a piece of garbage, you're not going to find many opportunities here.  I personally see this as a positive, but I know that some folks feel the other way.

#Cons
	##Posting
		-You can't quote toots like you can tweets in Twitter.
			-This is in the Cons section, but see below as to why it's probably more of a pro.
			-This was a deliberate choice.  Kinda silly for me to quote Mastodon's creator's too about not wanting to quote toots... but I'll power through!  Quote from Eugen Rochko:
				>I've made a deliberate choice against a quoting feature because it inevitably adds toxicity to people's behaviours. You are tempted to quote when you should be replying, and so you speak at your audience instead of with the person you are talking to. It becomes performative. Even when doing it for "good" like ridiculing awful comments, you are giving awful comments more eyeballs that way. No quote toots. Thank's
